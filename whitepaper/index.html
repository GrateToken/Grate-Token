      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        $GRATE is more than just a meme token; it's a movement. Built on the Solana blockchain and launched via Pump.fun, $GRATE is designed to foster a community-driven ecosystem focused on engagement and growth. We make no promises regarding additional utilities, NFTs, or extra features beyond the token itself.
